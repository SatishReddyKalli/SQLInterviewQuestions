--In problem1.jpg you can see the Input and desired to be displayed on the screen

-- let me brief you about the problem 

--input we have Team1, Team2 and winner 

--output we have to show the Team Name no.of matches a team played and no.of wins and no.of losses

-- Here we have DDL of the above input table
create table icc_world_cup
(
Team_1 Varchar(20),
Team_2 Varchar(20),
Winner Varchar(20)
);
INSERT INTO icc_world_cup values('India','SL','India');
INSERT INTO icc_world_cup values('SL','Aus','Aus');
INSERT INTO icc_world_cup values('SA','Eng','Eng');
INSERT INTO icc_world_cup values('Eng','NZ','NZ');
INSERT INTO icc_world_cup values('Aus','India','India');

--solution---

SELECT team_name ,count(1) as no_of_matchesplayed,sum(win_flag) as no_ofmatcheswins,COUNT(1) - sum(win_flag) as no_ofmatchelosses
from (select team_1 as team_name,case when team_1=winner then 1 else 0 end as win_flag from icc_world_cup
UNION ALL
select team_2 as team_name,case when team_2=winner then 1 else 0 end as win_flag from icc_world_cup)
group by team_name
ORDER by no_ofmatcheswins desc

we will explore step by step

step1 :

first select team1 and then check whether that team1 has won or not and store it another column as a flag for that we can use case when as below

"case when team1=winner then 1 else 0 end " here we are storing 1 and 0 in place whether a team has won or not now we got team1 status which we combine as below

"select team1 as team_name,case when team_1=winner then 1 else 0 end as win_flagfrom  icc_world_cup"


Second , similarly we will do for team_2

"select team2 as team_name,case when team_2=winner then 1 else 0 end as win_flagfrom  icc_world_cup"



step3 : we will union the above two steps because we will data of teams whether they win or lose also how many matches they played as below
select team_1 as team_name,case when team_1=winner then 1 else 0 end as win_flag from icc_world_cup
UNION ALL
select team_2 as team_name,case when team_2=winner then 1 else 0 end as win_flag from icc_world_cup



step4 : we will select necessary data from union of two queried which gives us like no.of matches by doing count ,sum using group by

select team_name,   --- team_name will give name as it is 
count(1) as no.of matches played,--by each country by using group by
sum(win_flag) as no.of wins, -- wins by each country by using group by with team_name
count(1) - sum(win_flag) as no.of losses -- by subtracting we will get loss matches
 from (
select team_1 as team_name,case when team_1=winner then 1 else 0 end as win_flag from icc_world_cup
UNION ALL
select team_2 as team_name,case when team_2=winner then 1 else 0 end as win_flag from icc_world_cup
)
group by team_name
